# TPA Gradle Plugin

## Introduction
This incubating plugin for Android projects aims at integrating with The Perfect App
through a proper Gradle plugin, as an alternative to project-dependent scripting using
Gradle, Groovy, Ant, Java and Bash. The plugin is still under development and you are 
encouraged to contribute.
